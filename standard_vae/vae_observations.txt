VAE Latent Dimension and Enhancement Analysis: Synthetic Data Quality Observations
============================================================

Notebook: standard_vae/Std_VAE.ipynb

1. Overview
-----------
- Three VAE experiments were conducted:
  1. **Basic VAE with latent_dim=2**
  2. **Basic VAE with latent_dim=8**
  3. **Enhanced VAE with latent_dim=8** (deeper encoder/decoder, early stopping, lower learning rate)
- The main focus is on the effect of latent dimension and architectural improvements on model performance and synthetic data quality.

2. Training and Loss Analysis
-----------------------------
- **Basic VAE (latent_dim=2 and 8):**
  - Both models trained for 100 epochs.
  - Loss and reconstruction_loss values are similar for both latent dimensions.
  - KL loss is lower for latent_dim=8 in early epochs, but this does not translate into better synthetic data quality.
- **Enhanced VAE (latent_dim=8):**
  - Deeper network, early stopping, and lower learning rate were used.
  - Early stopping typically halted training before 200 epochs, indicating good regularization.
  - Loss and validation loss are slightly lower and more stable compared to basic models.

3. Synthetic Data Quality: Descriptive Statistics
-------------------------------------------------
- **All models** produce synthetic data with means close to the real data.
- **Basic VAEs (latent_dim=2 and 8):**
  - Synthetic data has much lower standard deviation (std) and a narrower range than real data.
  - The model fails to capture the full variability and outliers of the real data.
- **Enhanced VAE (latent_dim=8):**
  - The std and range of synthetic data are improved compared to basic models, but still lower than real data.
  - The mean values remain close, and the synthetic data is slightly more diverse.

4. Synthetic Data Quality: Distribution Plots
---------------------------------------------
- **Basic VAEs:**
  - Synthetic data distributions are centered but overly concentrated, missing tails and outliers.
  - Increasing latent_dim from 2 to 8 does not significantly improve the spread.
- **Enhanced VAE:**
  - Distributions are more spread out and better match the real data, but still do not fully capture the tails.
  - The improvement is visible in KDE plots, especially for features with more complex distributions.

5. Effect of Latent Dimension and Enhancements
----------------------------------------------
- **Latent_dim=2 vs. 8 (basic):**
  - Minimal improvement in synthetic data quality by increasing latent_dim alone.
- **Enhanced VAE (latent_dim=8):**
  - Deeper network and early stopping provide better generalization and more realistic synthetic data.
  - Lower learning rate helps with stable convergence.
  - Still, the synthetic data does not fully match the variance and outlier structure of the real data.

6. Overall Observations
-----------------------
- **Best results** are achieved with the enhanced VAE (latent_dim=8, deeper network, early stopping, lower LR).
- However, even the enhanced model underestimates the variance and fails to generate outliers.
- The VAE is robust for generating synthetic data with correct means and general structure, but struggles with diversity and rare events.


7. Conclusion
-------------
- **Enhanced VAE with latent_dim=8 and architectural improvements is the best among the three tested.**
- For even better results, further tuning and advanced generative models should be explored.
