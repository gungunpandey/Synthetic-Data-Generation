## 📈 Distribution Analysis

### **Distribution Patterns**

#### **Normal-like Distributions**
- **Temperature**: Approximately normal with slight skewness
- **Humidity**: Normal distribution centered around 59.4%
- **Methane**: Right-skewed with outliers in higher ranges

#### **Multi-modal Distributions**
- **Moisture**: Shows multiple peaks, suggesting different operational modes
- **Sensor readings (R-series)**: Complex distributions with multiple modes

#### **Outlier Analysis**
- **Methane**: Significant outliers in the 3,000-10,000 ppb range
- **Sensor readings**: Wide ranges with potential outliers
- **Temperature**: Relatively clean with few outliers

## 🔗 Correlation Analysis

### **Expected Correlations**
1. **Temperature-Humidity**: Likely negative correlation (higher temp → lower humidity)
2. **Methane-Moisture**: Potential environmental relationship
3. **Sensor readings**: Inter-correlated due to similar measurement types

### **Correlation Patterns**
- **Strong correlations** between sensor readings (R-series)
- **Moderate correlations** between environmental factors
- **Weak correlations** between environmental and sensor readings

## 🎯 Insights for Synthetic Data Generation

### **Model Selection Recommendations**

#### **VAE Models**
- **Advantages**: 
  - Handles continuous data well
  - Can capture complex distributions
  - Good for multi-modal data
- **Recommended**: Standard VAE, β-VAE for disentanglement

#### **GAN Models**
- **Advantages**:
  - Can generate high-quality synthetic samples
  - Handles complex correlations well
- **Recommended**: CTGAN, TVAE, CopulaGAN (from SDV library)

### **Preprocessing Requirements**

#### **Normalization/Standardization**
- **Required**: All features need scaling due to different ranges
- **Method**: StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
- **Reason**: Sensor readings have much larger values than environmental factors

#### **Outlier Handling**
- **Methane outliers**: Consider if they represent real events or measurement errors
- **Sensor outliers**: May need clipping or robust scaling

#### **Feature Engineering**
- **Potential**: Create interaction terms between environmental factors
- **Consider**: Time-based features if temporal patterns exist
